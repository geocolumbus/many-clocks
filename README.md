## About

A pure javascript exercise to construct a clock from HTML elements, then make it tick, then make many of them of various sizes and try to fit them all on the screen. 

It wiggles the clocks around until they fit, and if it gets stuck, it removes the largest clock and keeps trying until each clock has a non-overlapping position and the system is stable.

## Why

Because javascript in browsers is fast and non-linear systems are cool and clocks are cool.
